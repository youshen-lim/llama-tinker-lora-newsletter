Newer LLMs like GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 show improved performance in these tasks compared to older generations, suggesting a better understanding of algorithms beyond simple memorization. This article tests models on Base64 and ROT20 encoded text, showing that larger models are more successful at tasks like decoding and character substitution, even with gibberish text.\n\nJSON only:\n{\"relevance_score\": <1-10>, \"summary\": \"<1 sentence>\", \"insights\": [\"<key point 1>\", \"<key point 2>\"]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"relevance_score\": 4,\n  \"summary\": \"Low-impact tech content with minimal relevance\",\n  \"insights\": [\n    \"Minor technical update\",\n    \"Limited practical significance\"\n  ]\n}"}], "metadata": {"source": "TLDR_digest", "content_length": 848, "generated": true, "created_at": "2025-10-16T18:09:08.851479", "extraction_method": "final_corrected_quality_filtered"}, "annotation": {"relevance_score": 9, "topics": ["AI Research", "AI Technique", "LLM Research", "LLM Technique"], "companies": [], "summary": "", "quality": 3, "notes": "", "status": "corrected"}}
