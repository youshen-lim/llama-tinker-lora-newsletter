When a new program is launched, the kernel places these variables on the stack as null-terminated strings, which the program then copies into its own data structure (like a hashmap in Bash or an array in glibc). While the Linux kernel and glibc are liberal about the format of environment variables, it's generally recommended to use uppercase letters, digits, and underscores for names, and UTF-8 encoding for values to avoid potential issues.\n\nJSON only:\n{\"relevance_score\": <1-10>, \"summary\": \"<1 sentence>\", \"insights\": [\"<key point 1>\", \"<key point 2>\"]}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"relevance_score\": 7,\n  \"summary\": \"Notable AI/tech progress with commercial implications\",\n  \"insights\": [\n    \"Meaningful development in technology\",\n    \"Potential market impact\"\n  ]\n}"}]}
